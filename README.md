Simple ransomware in python

**FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!!**

- This is a simple ransomware in python, this does not have a working decryptor, that is on purpose, so even if they pay, there files are lost
- Make a folder named "img" and upload "wallpaper.png" as a 1920x1080 image, to give them a custom wallpaper with a ransom note, change path in py file
- It also creates a text document with a note

**DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR HOST PC**

I may update this in the future but who knows

Thanks wannacry for the idea <3
